# Practical Go

A hands-on workspace dedicated to mastering the Go programming language through practice, experimentation, and building real-world applications.

## Projects

**[go-task-cli](./go-task-cli)** - A CLI task manager demonstrating Go fundamentals: structs, slices, error handling, and JSON persistence without traditional OOP concepts.

**[go-url-checker](./go-url-checker)** - A concurrent website checker and downloader demonstrating Go concurrency patterns: goroutines, channels, WaitGroups, mutex, and the worker pool pattern for bounded parallelism.
